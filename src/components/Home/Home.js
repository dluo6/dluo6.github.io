                    <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Danlin Luo, a computer science major at McGill University with a passion for technology, problem-solving, and creative projects. My academic journey has been enriched by hands-on experience, such as implementing environmental initiatives, researching influencer marketing under Professor Hyunji So, or contributing to the learning of other students through being a TEAM mentor.
                    <br /><br />
                    I'm always looking for opportunities to grow in various ways, whether it is exploring new skills, tinkering with projects, or taking a deeper dive into existing knowledge while maintaining balance in my life. It is fulfilling to make small steps daily, knowing that once I look back, I will have made much more progress than I could have thought would be possible.
